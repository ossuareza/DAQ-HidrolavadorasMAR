# DAQ-HidrolavadorasMAR

## Overview

This software controls the data acquisition system for a hydraulic pump characterization bench. It is designed for companies specializing in the commercialization and maintenance of hydraulic pumps and triplex reciprocating pumps. The system measures and stores pressure and flow data at multiple operating points, generating Pressure vs. Flow, Power vs. Flow, and Efficiency vs. Flow curves to find the point of maximum efficiency. All this information, along with pump data, is condensed into a report, standardizing the testing process and ensuring effective maintenance verification with traceable, repeatable reports for each pump.

## Features

- Data Acquisition: Collects real-time data from sensors.
- Data Processing: Checks stability in measurements and average them.
- Reporting: Generates detailed reports on machine performance.
- Sending reports: Send final report to desired E-mail.
- User interface: Offers a comfortable interface for the user to interact.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Main programming language for data handling and report generation.
- HTML: For pdf generation.
- Shell: Scripting and automation.
- PyQt: User interface.

## Usage

Run the main script to start the user interface for data acquisition:
    
    cd /home/pi/DAQ-HidrolavadorasMAR/generate_report_Py

    /usr/bin/python3 src/user_interface_Qt.py

Or just run the sh file `/home/pi/DAQ-HidrolavadorasMAR/generate_report_Py/src/run_script.sh` with the necessary permissions.
